Why AWS for Microsoft workloads?
The most experience
There is no compression algorithm for experience. We have been investing in making AWS the best place to run Microsoft workloads in the cloud since 2008, longer than any other cloud provider, so that we can provide you with the most operational experience, at greater scale, of any cloud. We’ve done it the longest and support the most demanding workloads. When experience matters, customers choose AWS.
Flexible licensing options
AWS is focused on reducing your licensing needs and complexity by providing
flexible licensing options
. You can either choose to bring your own licenses (BYOL) to maximize existing investments, or use the pay-as-you-go, license-included (LI) option to eliminate the hassle of managing license compliance.
License freedom
Software licenses are expensive, and many customers are looking for ways to break free from the restrictive terms and high cost of Microsoft licensing. By replacing your Microsoft-licensed products and applications with open-source alternatives and cloud-based technologies, you can lower costs, harden security, improve price performance, and speed up innovation.
Lower total cost of ownership
From licensing to infrastructure, AWS is focused on driving down your costs for running Microsoft workloads. For example, customers can save 77% on Windows Server and 45% on SQL Server license costs with
AWS Optimization and Licensing Assessment
. With
AWS Compute Optimizer
, customers save up to 25% on infrastructure through rightsizing and up to 74% on licenses through SQL Server edition downgrading recommendations.
The most performant and secure infrastructure
AWS offers the most secure, extensive, and reliable
Global Cloud Infrastructure
for you to run, optimize, and modernize your Microsoft workloads. Built for security from the ground up, AWS is trusted by millions of customers—including the world’s most security-sensitive organizations across government, healthcare, and financial services.
