Differences between instance states
Amazon EC2 instance state changes
An Amazon EC2 instance transitions through different states from the moment you launch it through
to its termination.
The following illustration represents the transitions between instance states.
You can receive notifications when your instances change states. For more information, see
State change events for Amazon EC2
instances
.
Billing by instance state
The following table provides a brief description of each instance state and indicates whether instance
usage is billed. Some AWS resources, such as Amazon EBS
volumes and Elastic IP addresses, incur charges regardless of the instance's state. For
more information, see
Avoiding Unexpected Charges
in the
AWS Billing User Guide
.
Instance state
Description
Instance usage billing
pending
The instance is preparing to enter the
running
state. An instance enters
the
pending
state when it is launched or when it is started
after being in the
stopped
state.
Not billed
running
The instance is running and ready for use.
Billed
stopping
The instance is preparing to be stopped.
Not billed
Note
If you hibernate an instance, you're billed while the instance is in the
stopping
state.
stopped
The instance is shut down and cannot be used. The instance can be started at any
time.
Not billed
shutting-down
The instance is preparing to be terminated.
Not billed
terminated
The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be started.
Not billed
Note
Reserved Instances that applied to terminated instances are billed until the end of
their term according to their payment option. For more information,
see
Reserved Instances for Amazon EC2 overview
Pending instances
When you launch an instance, it enters the
pending
state.
The instance type that you specified at launch determines the hardware of the host computer for your instance.
We use the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you specified at launch to boot the instance.
After the instance is ready for you, it enters the
running
state.
You can connect to your running instance and use it the way that you'd use a computer sitting in front of you.
As soon as your instance transitions to the
running
state, you're billed for
each second, with a one-minute minimum, that you keep the instance running, even if the
instance remains idle and you don't connect to it.
Stopped instances
If your instance fails a status check or is not running your applications as expected,
and if the root volume of your instance is an Amazon EBS volume, you can stop and start your instance
to try to fix the problem.
When you stop your instance, it enters the
stopping
state, and then the
stopped
state. You are not charged for usage or data transfer fees for
your instance when it is
stopped
. Charges are incurred for the storage of
any Amazon EBS volumes. While your instance is in the
stopped
state, you can
modify certain attributes of the instance, including the instance type.
When you start your instance, it enters the
pending
state, and the instance is
moved to a new host computer (though in some cases, it remains on the current host).
When you stop and start your instance, you lose any data on the instance store volumes
attached to the previous host computer.
Your instance retains its private IPv4 address, which means that an Elastic IP address
associated with the private IPv4 address or network interface remains associated with
your instance. If your instance has an IPv6 address, it retains the IPv6 address.
Each time you transition an instance from
stopped
to
running
, you
are charged per second when the instance is running, with a minimum of one minute per
instance start.
For more details about stopping and starting an instance, see
Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances
.
Hibernated instances
When you hibernate an instance, we signal the operating system to perform hibernation
(suspend-to-disk), which saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon EBS
root volume. We persist the instance's Amazon EBS root volume and any attached Amazon EBS data
volumes. When you start your instance, the Amazon EBS root volume is restored to its previous
state and the RAM contents are reloaded. Previously attached data volumes are reattached
and the instance retains its instance ID.
When you hibernate your instance, it enters the
stopping
state, and then the
stopped
state. We don't charge
usage for a hibernated instance when it is in the
stopped
state, but we do
charge while it is in the
stopping
state, unlike when you
stop an instance
without hibernating it. We
don't charge usage for data transfer fees, but we do charge for the storage for any
Amazon EBS volumes, including storage for the RAM data.
When you start your hibernated instance, it enters the
pending
state, and we move the instance to a new host computer (though in some cases, it remains on the current host).
Your instance retains its private IPv4 address, which means that an Elastic IP address
associated with the private IPv4 address or network interface is still associated with
your instance. If your instance has an IPv6 address, it retains its IPv6 address.
For more information, see
Hibernate your Amazon EC2 instance
.
Rebooting instances
You can reboot your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, a command line tool, and the Amazon EC2
API. We recommend that you use Amazon EC2 to reboot your instance instead of running the
operating system reboot command from your instance.
Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. The instance remains
on the same host computer and maintains its public DNS name, private IP address, and any
data on its instance store volumes. It typically takes a few minutes for the reboot to
complete, but the time it takes to reboot depends on the instance configuration.
Rebooting an instance doesn't start a new instance billing period; per second billing continues without a
further one-minute minimum charge.
For more information, see
Reboot your Amazon EC2 instance
.
Terminated instances
When you've decided that you no longer need an instance, you can terminate it. As soon as the
status of an instance changes to
shutting-down
or
terminated
,
you stop incurring charges for that instance.
If you enable termination protection, you can't terminate the instance using the console,
CLI, or API.
After you terminate an instance, it remains visible in the console for a short while, and
then the entry is automatically deleted. You can also describe a terminated instance
using the CLI and API. Resources (such as tags) are gradually disassociated from the
terminated instance, therefore may no longer be visible on the terminated instance after
a short while. You can't connect to or recover a terminated instance.
Each Amazon EBS-backed instance supports the
InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
attribute, which controls whether the instance stops or terminates when you initiate
shutdown from within the instance itself (for example, by using the
shutdown
command on Linux). The default behavior is
to stop the instance. You can modify the setting of this attribute while the instance is
running or stopped.
Each Amazon EBS volume supports the
DeleteOnTermination
attribute, which controls
whether the volume is deleted or preserved when you terminate the instance it is
attached to. The default is to delete the root device volume and preserve any other EBS
volumes.
For more information, see
Terminate Amazon EC2 instances
.

Billing
The instance billing hour doesn't change
You stop incurring charges for an instance as soon as its state changes to
stopping
. Each time an instance transitions from
stopped
to
running
, we start a new
instance billing period, billing a minimum of one minute every time
you start your instance.
You incur charges while the instance is in the
stopping
state, but stop
incurring charges when the instance is in the
stopped
state. Each time an instance transitions from
stopped
to
running
, we start a new instance billing period, billing a
minimum of one minute every time you start your
instance.
You stop incurring charges for an instance as soon as its state
changes to
shutting-down
Operating system shutdown commands always terminate an instance store-backed instance.
You can control whether operating system shutdown commands stop or terminate an
Amazon EBS-backed instance. For more information, see
