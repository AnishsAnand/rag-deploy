Elastic network interfaces
An
elastic network interface
is a logical networking component in a VPC that
represents a virtual network card. You can create and configure network interfaces and attach them
to instances that you launch in the same Availability Zone. The attributes of a network interface
follow it as it's attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. When
you move a network interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected from the
original instance to the new instance.
Note that this AWS resource is referred to as a
network interface
in the
AWS Management Console and the Amazon EC2 API. Therefore, we use "network interface" in this documentation instead of
"elastic network interface". The term "network interface" in this documentation always means
"elastic network interface".
Network interface attributes
A network interface can include the following attributes:
A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your subnet
A primary IPv6 address from the IPv6 address range of your subnet
Secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your subnet
One Elastic IP address (IPv4) for each private IPv4 address
One public IPv4 address
Secondary IPv6 addresses
Security groups
A MAC address
A source/destination check flag
A description
Monitoring traffic
You can enable a VPC flow log on your network interface to capture information
about the traffic going to and from a network interface. After you've created a
flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see
VPC Flow Logs
in the
Amazon VPC User Guide

Network interface concepts
The following are important concepts to understand as you get started using
network interfaces.
Primary network interface
Each instance has a default network interface, called the
primary
network interface
. You can't detach a primary network interface from
an instance.
Secondary network interfaces
You can create and attach secondary network interfaces to your instance. The
maximum number of network interfaces varies by instance type. For more information,
see
Maximum IP addresses per network interface
.
IPv4 addresses for network interfaces
When you launch an EC2 instance into an IPv4-only or dual stack subnet, the instance
receives a primary private IP address from the IPv4 address range of the subnet. You
can also specify additional private IPv4 addresses, known as secondary private IPv4
addresses. Unlike primary private IP addresses, secondary private IP addresses can be
reassigned from one instance to another.
Public IPv4 addresses for network interfaces
All subnets have a modifiable attribute that determines whether network
interfaces created in that subnet (and therefore instances launched into that
subnet) are assigned a public IPv4 address. For more information, see
Subnet settings
in the
Amazon VPC User Guide
. When you launch an instance, the IP address
is assigned to the primary network interface. If you specify an existing network interface
as the primary network interface when you launch an instance, the public IPv4 address
is determined by this network interface.
When you create a network interface, it inherits the public IPv4 addressing attribute
from the subnet. If you later modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute of the subnet,
the network interface keeps the setting that was in effect when it was created.
We release the public IP address when the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated.
We assign a new public IP address when you start your stopped or hibernated instance,
unless it has a secondary network interface or a secondary private IPv4 address that is
associated with an Elastic IP address.
IPv6 addresses for network interfaces
If you associate IPv6 CIDR blocks with your VPC and subnet, you can assign IPv6
addresses from the subnet range to a network interface. Each IPv6 address can be
assigned to one network interface.
All subnets have a modifiable attribute that determines whether network interfaces
created in that subnet (and therefore instances launched into that subnet) are
automatically assigned an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet. When you launch
an instance, the IPv6 address is assigned to the primary network interface.
Elastic IP addresses for network interfaces
You can associate an Elastic IP address with one of the private IPv4 addresses
for the network interface. You can associate one Elastic IP address with each
private IPv4 address. If you disassociate an Elastic IP address from a network interface,
you can release it or associate it with a different instance.
Termination behavior
You can set the termination behavior for a network interface that's attached to an
instance. You can specify whether the network interface should be automatically
deleted when you terminate the instance to which it's attached.
Source/destination checking
You can enable or disable source/destination checks, which ensure that the
instance is either the source or the destination of any traffic that it receives.
Source/destination checks are enabled by default. You must disable source/destination
checks if the instance runs services such as network address
translation, routing, or firewalls.
Requester-managed network interfaces
These network interfaces are created and managed by AWS services to enable you to use
some resources and services. You can't manage these network interfaces yourself. For more
information, see
Requester-managed network interfaces
.
Prefix delegation
A prefix is a reserved private IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range that you
allocate for automatic or manual assignment to network interfaces that are
associated with an instance. By using Delegated Prefixes, you can launch services
faster by assigning a range of IP addresses as a single prefix.
Managed network interfaces
A
managed network interface
is managed by a service
provider, such as Amazon EKS Auto Mode. You canât directly modify the settings of
a managed network interface. Managed network interface are identified by a
true
value in the
Managed
field. For more information, see
Amazon EC2 managed instances
.
Network cards
Most instance types support one network card. Instance types that support multiple
network cards provide higher network performance, including bandwidth capabilities
above 100 Gbps and improved packet rate performance. When you attach a network
interface to an instance that supports multiple network cards, you can select the
network card for the network interface. The primary network interface must be
assigned to network card index 0.
EFA and EFA-only network interfaces count as a network interface. You can assign
only one EFA or EFA-only network interface per network card. The primary network
interface can't be an EFA-only network interface.
The following instance types support multiple network cards. For information about
the number of network interfaces that an instance type supports, see
Maximum IP addresses per network interface
